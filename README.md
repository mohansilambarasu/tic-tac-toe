Tic Tac Toe Project

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows two players to take turns and compete to get three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal. The game also checks for a draw and announces the winner or declares a tie when the game ends.
